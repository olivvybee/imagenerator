    <p>
      Alt text is used to describe images for people who can't otherwise view
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, someone who is partially sighted might use software called a
      screen reader, where the computer reads out what's on the screen. Alt text
      is used by that software, since computers aren't able to accurately
      describe an image without help.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're sharing images on social media, please consider adding alt text
      so that they're accessible to everyone. Some of my generators offer
      suggested alt text that you can copy and paste to make it easier.
